# Task 2 - Notes Web App

This repository contains a solution for a notes web app developed using ReactJS for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a simple notes web app utilizing ReactJS for the frontend interface and Node.js with MySQL but I am not familiar with MySQL so I am using MongoDB for the backend database. The app allows users to add and delete notes, with the ability to insert data into a MongoDB database.

## Features

- ReactJS utilized for frontend development
- Node.js with MongoDB for backend functionality
- Simple and intuitive design for ease of use
- Functionality to add and delete notes

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/izhar100/iwc.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `Task2` directory.

3. Install dependencies for the frontend and backend (follow instructions in respective `README.md` files).

4. Start the frontend and backend servers.

5. Access the app in your web browser and interact with the notes interface.

## Backend Information

The backend for this project is implemented using Node.js with MongoDB as the database. While the original task specified MySQL, due to development requirements, Node.js with MongoDB was chosen for the backend implementation.
