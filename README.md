# Task 1 - ReactJS Frontend Task

This repository contains a solution for a frontend task using ReactJS to create a simple HTML page with editable columns.

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate a simple HTML page created using ReactJS. The page consists of editable columns that are designed either in table format or div format, based on the provided requirements. The editable columns allow users to input data, and the application is prepared to handle posting this data to an API for potential storage in a database.

## Features

- Utilizes ReactJS for frontend development
- Implements editable columns for user input
- Prepared to handle data posting to an API

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/izhar100/iwc.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Interact with the editable columns to input data.

4. To integrate with an API for data submission, modify the appropriate sections of the code related to API endpoints and data formatting.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally or integrate it with your backend:

- Ensure you have a compatible development environment for ReactJS.
- Customize API endpoints and data formatting as needed in the code.

# Task 2 - Notes Web App

This repository contains a solution for a notes web app developed using ReactJS for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a simple notes web app utilizing ReactJS for the frontend interface and Node.js with MySQL but I am not familiar with MySQL so I am using MongoDB for the backend database. The app allows users to add and delete notes, with the ability to insert data into a MongoDB database.

## Features

- ReactJS utilized for frontend development
- Node.js with MongoDB for backend functionality
- Simple and intuitive design for ease of use
- Functionality to add and delete notes

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/izhar100/iwc.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `Task2` directory.

3. Install dependencies for the frontend and backend (follow instructions in respective `README.md` files).

4. Start the frontend and backend servers.

5. Access the app in your web browser and interact with the notes interface.

## Backend Information

The backend for this project is implemented using Node.js with MongoDB as the database. While the original task specified MySQL, due to development requirements, Node.js with MongoDB was chosen for the backend implementation.

## Resources

- [Task 2 Repository](https://github.com/izhar100/iwc/tree/main/Task2)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

- Set up MongoDB and Node.js on your system.
- Follow the instructions in the `README.md` files in the `frontend` and `backend` directories for setup and configuration.
